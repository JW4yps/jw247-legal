      <h2>1) Disclaimer (Non-Affiliation)</h2>
      <p>
        JW24/7 is an independent, unofficial app created to help users organize personal ministry-related notes and schedules.
        It is <strong>not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by</strong> JW.org or the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
        Official resources are available at JW.org and in JW Library.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="privacy" class="card">
      <h2>2) Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> JW24/7 stores user-entered information on your device. The developer does not receive your in-app content. Some features use third-party services (example: maps), which may process technical data to provide those features.</p>

      <h3 class="small">2.1 Data the app stores (on-device)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-entered content:</strong> notes, calls/visits, addresses, phone numbers, territories, schedule items, and similar information you choose to enter.</li>
        <li><strong>Local storage only:</strong> data is stored on your device (for example using local storage / local database). It is not transmitted to the developer’s servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="small">2.2 Data the developer collects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account required:</strong> no mandatory account creation or sign-in is required to use the app (unless you enable optional features in a future release).</li>
        <li><strong>No in-app analytics/crash SDKs:</strong> the mobile app does not currently include third-party analytics or crash-reporting SDKs.</li>
        <li><strong>No sale of personal data:</strong> the developer does not sell your personal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="small">2.3 Permissions & sensitive features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Location (When In Use):</strong> if you allow it, the app can use your device location to help map territories/addresses.
          You can deny or revoke location permission in your device settings; the app should still work with reduced map convenience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maps:</strong> map features use Google Maps SDK/APIs when enabled and configured (API key).
          Google may receive technical information (such as IP address, device identifiers, and approximate location depending on your settings/permissions) to provide mapping and geocoding services.
          Your use of Google Maps is subject to Google’s privacy policy and terms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="small">2.4 Links to external services</h3>
      <p>
        JW24/7 may open external apps or links (example: phone dialer, messaging apps, Google Voice, WhatsApp, websites).
        Those third-party services handle data under their own privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h3 class="small">2.5 Website analytics (this page / site)</h3>
      <p>
        If enabled on this website, we may use privacy-focused, aggregate traffic analytics (for example, to understand approximate traffic volume and countries).
        This is for the website only and does not include your in-app notes/content.
        <br />
        <span class="small">If you do not enable website analytics, remove this section.</span>
      </p>

      <h3 class="small">2.6 User controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> you can delete entries inside the app. You can also remove all local app data by uninstalling the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Export/backup (if available):</strong> if the app offers export/backup, you control where you store exported files.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="small">2.7 Data retention</h3>
      <p>
        Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
      </p>

      <h3 class="small">2.8 Children</h3>
      <p>
        JW24/7 is not directed to children under 13. Do not submit personal information about minors unless you have the legal right to do so.
      </p>

      <h3 class="small">2.9 Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy. The “Effective date” above reflects the latest version.
      </p>
