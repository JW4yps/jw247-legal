      <h2>1) Disclaimer (Non-Affiliation)</h2>
      <p>
        JW24/7 is an independent, unofficial app created to help users organize personal ministry-related notes and schedules.
        It is <strong>not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by</strong> JW.org or the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
        Official resources are available at JW.org and in JW Library.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Store listing short disclaimer (copy/paste):<br />
        “JW24/7 is an independent, unofficial app. Not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by JW.org or the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="privacy" class="card">
      <h2>2) Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> JW24/7 stores user-entered information locally on your device. The developer does not receive your in-app content. Some features may open or rely on third-party services (such as maps or phone/messaging apps) which process data under their own policies.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Data stored on your device (local-only)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-entered content:</strong> notes, calls/visits, addresses, phone numbers, territories, schedule items, and related information you choose to enter.</li>
        <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> this information is stored on your device (for example using local storage / local database). It is not transmitted to the developer’s servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Data the developer collects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account required:</strong> no account creation or sign-in is required to use the app.</li>
        <li><strong>No in-app analytics/crash SDKs:</strong> the mobile app does not currently include analytics or crash-reporting SDKs.</li>
        <li><strong>No sale or sharing of personal data:</strong> the developer does not sell or share your personal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Camera permission</h3>
      <p>
        JW24/7 may request access to your device’s camera for optional features such as capturing or scanning images.
        Camera access is used only when you choose to use these features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images and any related data captured using the camera remain stored locally on your device.
        The app does not transmit camera images or related data to the developer or to external servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may deny or revoke camera permission at any time in your device settings. The app will continue to function,
        except for features that require camera access.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Location permission</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to allow it, JW24/7 may use your device’s location to help map territories and addresses.
        You can deny or revoke location permission in your device settings; the app will continue to function with reduced map convenience.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 Maps and geocoding</h3>
      <p>
        When map features are enabled and configured, JW24/7 may use Google Maps SDK/APIs to display maps and assist with mapping addresses.
        Google may process technical information (such as IP address, device identifiers, and approximate location depending on your settings/permissions)
        to provide mapping services. Your use of Google Maps is subject to Google’s terms and privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>2.6 Links to external services</h3>
      <p>
        The app may open external services (example: phone dialer, messaging apps, Google Voice, WhatsApp, websites).
        Those third-party services handle data under their own privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h3>2.7 Website analytics (this website only, optional)</h3>
      <p>
        If enabled on this website, we may use privacy-focused, aggregate traffic analytics to understand basic traffic volume
        (including approximate country/region). This does not include your in-app notes/content.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        If you do not use website analytics, remove this section.
      </p>

      <h3>2.8 User controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> you can delete entries inside the app. You can remove all app data by uninstalling the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Export/backup (if available):</strong> if the app offers export/backup, you control where exported files are stored.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.9 Data retention</h3>
      <p>
        Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
      </p>

      <h3>2.10 Children</h3>
      <p>
        JW24/7 is not directed to children under 13. Do not enter personal information about minors unless you have the legal right to do so.
      </p>

      <h3>2.11 Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy. The “Effective date” above reflects the latest version.
      </p>
